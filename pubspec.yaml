description: CDNBye flutter P2P Engine scales live/vod video streaming by peer-to-peer network using bittorrent-like protocol. Powered by WebRTC Datachannel, this SDK can interconnect with the Web side plug-in of CDNBye, which breaks the gap between the browser and mobile application. As expected, it supports any flutter player!
